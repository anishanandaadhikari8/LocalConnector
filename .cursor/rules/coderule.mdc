  Ensure the application always starts successfully, with working frontend and backend.
  Cursor must:
    - Always check **requirements.txt**, backend.txt, frontend.txt, and cursor logs.
    - Never break the existing app; incremental safe changes only.
    - Add automated **test cases** for every feature/fix.
    - Validate UI/UX matches the design requirements (Fortune 500â€“level polish).
    - Confirm that requirements are met before committing changes.
    - Avoid terminal or half-baked commands; ensure code runs inside the app.
    - Treat every update as production-grade with error handling, mocks if needed.
    - Work in small, verifiable steps: implement, run, verify, log.
    - If a requirement is unclear, stop and ask before assuming.
    - The web application should always start and there should not be any error with dependency or starting the application
