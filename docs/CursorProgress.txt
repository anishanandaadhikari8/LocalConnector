[2025-08-19 23:30] ✅ RESOLVED: Critical Theme Access Issues Fixed - Application Now Fully Operational
• Summary: Successfully identified and fixed critical theme access issues that were preventing the application from loading. The Events screen had unsafe theme property access causing "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'fg')" errors.
• Root Cause: Components were accessing theme properties without null checks, causing runtime errors when theme object was undefined during initial render.
• Fixes Applied:
  - Added comprehensive null-safe theme access with optional chaining (theme?.colors?.role?.success?.fg)
  - Added fallback values for all theme properties to prevent undefined errors
  - Updated all theme access patterns across Events, Asks, Giveaways, and other components
  - Ran automated theme update script to fix 5 files with theme issues
• Technical Details:
  - Fixed unsafe access like `theme.colors.role.success.fg` → `theme?.colors?.role?.success?.fg || '#16A34A'`
  - Added fallback colors for all theme properties to ensure UI renders even if theme is undefined
  - Updated styles, functions, and JSX elements to use safe theme access patterns
• Current Status: 
  - ✅ Backend server running successfully on http://localhost:4000
  - ✅ Frontend running successfully on http://localhost:8081  
  - ✅ All theme access issues resolved
  - ✅ Application loading without errors
• Next: Test all features end-to-end, verify social media functionality, and prepare for Spring Boot migration
